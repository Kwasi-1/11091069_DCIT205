## Introduction
Welcome to the website of the Department of Computer Science! The goal of this project is to create a thorough 10-page website for the University of Ghana's Department of Computer Science. This website's goal is to give visitors information about the department, its instructors, its research projects, courses, and any other pertinent facts. The website is intended to be useful, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to use.

## Clone and Set up project

## What I've Learned
During the course of developing this project, I acquired practical knowledge in:

  Guidelines and optimal methods for designing websites.

  Creating a user interface that is both accessible and responsive.

  Creating, arranging, and displaying content on a webpage in an efficient manner.

Through this project, I was able to build skills that are necessary in the web development profession and apply my academic knowledge in a practical setting.
Feel free to make suggestions or comments regarding the codebase; I believe this website does a decent job of reflecting the Department of Computer Science.
